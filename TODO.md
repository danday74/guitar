* remove unwanted codemirror plugins
* lint action buttons don't remove whole line
* css class for different types of lint errors to support diff styles - remove squiggly underlines?
* spellcheck on lyrics - with typo-js

* format line endings to LR
* lint repeat chords
* dont lint until submit or on request?
* page scrolls
* solid line (emdash) if multiple hyphens?
* logging util
* login / logout (needed for adding songs)
* spelling ignore / add to dict (needs user accounts)
* lang select (for spelling - needs user accounts)
* lint errors should not show immediately, they should only show after failed submit (excluding typos which should always show)
* spelling suggestions color is purple (on popup) but underline is red - doesn't feel consistent

* zebra stripes not on alternative lines but on chord lines?

* thin scrollbar 4 code completion
* rethink color scheme - including codemirror (default color scheme has no bg)
  nice glowing white color for lyrics - professional blue smooth
* linting extension
* undo and redo buttons? (history extension)
* auto formatting (on change line?)
* make it scroll horizontally and vertically if it gets too big for container

after chords and lyrics entered?
* flats to sharps, sharps to flats
* transpose
* pink highlight for women, blue highlight for men

* think about how it works - slide in drawers, tabs, progress circle indicators, etc
* enforce rules with err message - e.g. all verses must be same number of lines, chords line must be above lyric line

* codemirror autofocus
* consider signals
* ngFor and ngIf removal
* location of files - esp TChord and other common types and interfaces
* what is lyrics and chords interface
* ng add @angular/ssr
* spellcheck enhance (add words) - may need a diff lib - e.g. nspell (but low usage and poor updates) - works with dictionary-en and other dicts

* TODOs
